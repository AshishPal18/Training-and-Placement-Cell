Problem Statement:

The aim of this project is to develop an online application for training and placement department of our college. The system is an application that can be accessed throughout the college with proper login provided. This system can be used as an application for the Training and the Placement officers (TPO) of the college to manage the student information with regard to placement. Student login should be able to upload their information in the form of CV. The application provides the facility of maintaining the details of the students. It also provides a requested list of candidates to recruit the students based on given query. Administrator logging in may also search any information put up by the students.

Purpose:

 For the purpose of training and placement of the student in colleges, TPO’s have to collect the information and CV’s of students and manages them manually and arranges them according to various streams.

•	Collecting marks from green book
Marks of each student are collected from green book (a book containing marks and other details maintained by each department in college).
•	Preparing excel sheet
From the data collected through filled-forms and green book, excel sheets are prepared.
These excel sheets are used to prepare a list of students who full-fill the requirements of a company visiting the campus and these students are eligible to attend the campus placement.
